### Crime incidents in Philadelphia
Hi everyone, I am publishing this post as part of "The ultimate value embedded in Data" series with the aim to share my learning journey as a data scientist.

The data-set that I am using today is hosted by [OpenDataPhilly] (https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents) and its a detailed list of all crimes that happened in Philadelphia between 2006 and April 2016.
